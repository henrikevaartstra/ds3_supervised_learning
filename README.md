# Repository for Data Science 3 - Supervised Learning (july 2021)
Henrike Vaartstra 352664

## Readme
The data can be found in the folder 'data'. In this folder there are two files, which are both read in in the jupyter notebook.
The first file ending with '.names' contains the descriptions of the observations and the file ending with '.data' contains the actual observations themselves.

The folder 'run-images' contains the images that I have run while creating this notebook. I decided to already place them into a seperate file because, as I also indicate in the notebook, running/plotting the learning curves takes some time (therefor they are commented out at default) and thus you do not have to run them and can already find them in this folder.

#### To run the notebook:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the file '352664_supervised_learning_DS3_final.ipynb'
